# Word_Counting

The purpose of this script is to be able to count the number of words in a text file and possibly even a website page and also count the frequency of each word. Included is a stopwords.txt which is a list of words, symbols etc that should not be counted in the word count to make it smoother and also remove common repeated words which aren't useful for the user.
